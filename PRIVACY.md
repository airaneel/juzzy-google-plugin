# Privacy Policy

This plugin sends search queries to the Google Custom Search API using your own API key and Custom Search Engine ID. No data is collected, stored, or shared by the plugin author.

All API requests are made directly from your Dify instance to Google's servers. Refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for how Google handles search data.

The Web Crawl tool fetches publicly accessible web pages. Page content is processed locally within your Dify instance and is not transmitted to any third party beyond the target URL.
